application under development....

Hello,

I'm createing wallet web application to manage monthly budget. It's simply app which can easly help us in our daily life.

To start use app you need to click add new transaction and input your whole monthly budget or your left to end of the month budget.

Now when you have some resources, you can add your expenses and calculate them.

Now you can see how much you can speend for day left to the end of the month and for whole month.

Your welcome!

Here is online version to test it: https://friendly-bublanina-ec2d39.netlify.app/
